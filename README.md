# PRISMATIC WATCHER
Since the Roblox platform does not provide any way to detect when a PrismaticConstraint's movement has stopped or ended, nor to wait for it to stop. To address this, I wrote this module to detect when the movement of a PrismaticConstraint has stopped or wait until the movement is stopped.

However, you can integrate with TweenService and wait for the tween to end then proceed.

## FUNCTIONS

1. `.new(Instance, Precision)`
2. `:IsStopped() -> Boolean`
3. `:WaitUntilStopped()`
