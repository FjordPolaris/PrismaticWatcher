# PRISMATIC WATCHER
Since the Roblox platform does not provide any way to detect when a PrismaticConstraint's movement has stopped or ended, nor to wait for it to stop. To address this, I write this module to detect when the movement of a PrismaticConstraint has stopped or wait until the movement is stopped. 

## FUNCTIONS

`.new(PrismaticObject, Setting)`
